<em>The true form of a Skin-Stealer.</em>
</p>

<h3>Entity Number: 10</h3>

<h4>Habitat</h4>
<p align="left">Majority (Most commonly Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3)</p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p align="left">
Entity 10, also known as the Skin-Stealer, is a large humanoid entity that can wear the skin of its victims as a disguise. It consumes human flesh when hungry, and otherwise wanders aimlessly. Its blood is translucent, and it can mimic human speech. Most sightings occur on the first three levels, though it has been seen in other areas as well.
</p>

<h4>Behaviors</h4>
<p align="left">
Skin-Stealers are usually docile unless they are in a hunger state. When hungry, they actively seek out solitary humans and use their strength to tear them apart. In a non-hungry state, they wander and are not hostile unless provoked.
</p>

<h4>Biology</h4>
<p align="left">
Skin-Stealers are tall, pale yellow humanoids with sunken white eyes. Their outer flesh has microscopic bumps like octopus suckers that attach to human skin, stretching it over their bodies until it perfectly mimics a human. These bumps pump blood and nutrients to keep the skin warm, alive, and free from decomposition or cuts. After about 24 hours, the skin is digested, and the entity returns to a docile state. They can speak by repeating heard words but do not understand language. Their blood is completely translucent.
</p>

<h4>Discovery</h4>
<p align="left">
Sightings of Skin-Stealers predate the creation of the M.E.G. by over five years. Being common entities, they are among the first encounters for new Wanderers.
</p>

<h4>Do's and Don'ts</h4>
<p align="left"><b>Do:</b></p>
<ul align="left">
<li>Walk away slowly and calmly if you see one.</li>
<li>Check companions for clear blood to ensure they are not disguised.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><b>Don't:</b></p>
<ul align="left">
<li>Trust people who speak in random or disjointed words.</li>
<li>Aggravate a Skin-Stealer in its docile state.</li>
</ul>
