Level ! is the most dangerous anomalous level in the Backrooms, and nobody should deliberately enter it for any purpose, otherwise you will do so at your own risk. It is known by various names, such as Run for your life!, Level Run, or simply Run. Prior to the introduction of CBNS, it was also known as Area-847.

<h3 align="left">Entry</h3>
<p align="left">
Generally speaking, there are two main ways to enter Level !.<br><br>
The first way is to pass through an exit door that is incompatible with its surroundings. These doors are believed to appear randomly in any level, and their positions keep changing, making it difficult for the M.E.G. to block them. Once you enter this door, it will close immediately. When the wanderer turns back, they will find a huge red exclamation mark printed on the door. At this point, they are already in Level !.<br><br>
The second way usually involves a series of elements related to exclamation marks. For example, noclipping into objects related to exclamation marks may lead to entering this level. Additionally, walking into an elevator with an exclamation mark printed on it may result in the door opening to reveal that the wanderer has entered Level !.<br><br>
In addition, there are some other ways that may lead to entering Level !. Having a certain thought in Level 354 will definitely cause the wanderer to enter this level. Noclipping through the floor in Level 2 also has a chance of enabling the wanderer to enter this level.<br><br>
When multiple people enter the level at the same time, they will be forced to separate.

<h3 align="left">Arrival</h3>
<p align="left">
When wanderers reach this level, they will find themselves in a room illuminated by red light. The room is furnished in a very simple manner, with only some basic items. In the center of the room stands a hospital bed, on which several quilts are neatly folded. Next to the bed is a bedside table for placing daily items, and on one side of the bed, there is a curtain that can be used for screening. In the corner of the room, there is a medicine cabinet for storing medications.<br><br>
Wanderers can sometimes find useful supplies such as almond water, energy bars, etc. They are often placed in the corners of bedside tables or medicine cabinets, and other places. These supplies will give the wanderer energy to prepare for the rest of the run.<br><br>
Apart from the door through which the wanderer entered (if the wanderer entered this level through the exit door), there are two other doors in the room, facing each other. One of the doors is tightly chained shut. Although it is difficult to see what is behind the door from the outside, the sound of countless entities trying to break through the door can be heard from the other side. The other door leads to a hallway, which is the only way for the wanderers.<br><br>
It should be noted that, in extremely rare cases, instead of appearing in the aforementioned room, wanderers will directly enter the hallway upon arriving at this level. The triggering mechanism of this special situation remains unclear.

<h3 align="left">Hallway</h3>
<p align="left">
After leaving the room, wanderers will enter a hallway that is ten kilometers long. The appearance of this hallway is similar to that of a modern hospital hallway. There are exit signs installed on the ceiling, emitting a deep red glow, which is considered to be the only light source within the level. These exit signs are installed in almost random positions, resulting in some areas being overly bright while some are plunged into complete darkness. For this reason, flashlights are regarded as highly practical supplies, which can effectively help wanderers avoid obstacles in dark areas.<br><br>
Obstacles are randomly placed within the level and may slide around randomly, causing great inconvenience to the wanderers' movement. Large obstacles (such as chairs, beds, etc.) may block the wanderers' progress when running forward, while smaller obstacles (such as toy cars, boxes, etc.) are even more lethal, they are difficult to spot, yet can cause wanderers to trip and waste a great deal of time.<br><br>
An alarm of unknown origin is continuously playing within the level. The loudness is extremely high, and it has been proven to be harmful to the mental state of wanderers. Wanderers may become panicked due to this alarm and are unable to think rationally, ultimately leading to being caught by entities. Some people believe that this alarm actually exists in the wanderers' minds rather than within the level, but this view has not been confirmed.<br><br>
On both sides of the Hallway are doors made of an unknown metal, which are indestructible. Most of these doors cannot be opened for unknown reasons. Some of the doors that can be opened may lead to a room. Although there may be supplies in the room, once a Wanderer enters, it is almost impossible for them to get out again. In addition, there may be other entities inside these doors. For these reasons, Wanderers should not attempt to open the doors on either side of the Hallway.<br><br>
When the entities break through the door, they will start chasing the Wanderers. The entities here are complex and diverse, encompassing almost all of the entities in the Backrooms, including Deathmoths, Smilers, Partygoers, Aranea Membri, Skin-Stealers, etc. Strangely, the speeds of these entities are nearly the same in this level.

<h3 align="left"><font color="blue">Safe Zone</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font color="blue">
The Safe Zone is an area within Level ! where one can take a rest, no entity is likely to enter here. It can be said that this area is extremely rare, and not all wanderers can come across it. In the confirmed reports, only about 6% of them mention this area.<br><br>
The Safe Zone is a place similar to the exterior area of Level !, but unlike the Corridor, it is predominantly blue and significantly more well-lit. Doors on both sides can be opened, and behind the doors is a room. The furnishings in the room include a shelf and a bed. Wanderers can find items including almond water, energy bars, and more in these places.<br><br>
If you want to leave the safe zone, just go out through the door at the end of the safe zone. After exiting the door of the safe zone, the entity will enter through the entrance of the safe zone and continue to chase the wanderer.
</font></p>

<h3 align="left">The Exit</h3>
<p align="left">
After running for approximately 10 km, the wanderer will reach the exit of Level !. If the wanderer looks to both sides and there are no other hallways, this is a true exit door. Exiting through this door usually means escaping Level !. It is important to note that after exiting the level, it is important to close and mark the exit door, as it has been documented that the exit door has been converted into an entrance door.<br><br>
Once a wanderer leaves Level !, he will not re-enter. If he attempts to enter an entrance door to a level, he will only reach another location in the level he was in.<br><br>
In the known reports, wanderers who leave Level ! mostly arrive at safer levels, which means that the threat index of these levels is usually Class Habitable, Class 0, and Class 1, with the most reached levels being Level 1 and Level 4.<br><br>
However, in very, very rare cases, an exit door may allow you to re-enter Level !. In this case, only a very small number of wanderers have escaped the level for the second time.
